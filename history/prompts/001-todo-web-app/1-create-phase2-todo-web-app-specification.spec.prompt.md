## Prompt

/sp.specify Create speckit.specify for Phase-2 Todo Web Application. Include: 1. User journeys: - Signup - Login - Create task - View task list - Update task - Delete task - Mark task complete 2. Functional requirements: - Multi-user support - Persistent storage - REST API communication - Authentication required for all actions 3.

## Response snapshot

Created the feature specification and quality checklist for the Phase-2 Todo Web Application, outlining user journeys, functional and non-functional requirements, acceptance criteria, and out-of-scope items.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Successfully created the feature specification (spec.md) and its corresponding quality checklist (requirements.md) for the Phase-2 Todo Web Application.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: Two files created/modified: specs/001-todo-web-app/spec.md, specs/001-todo-web-app/checklists/requirements.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: The specification is ready for review and subsequent planning (e.g., /sp.plan).
- 🧠 Reflection: Despite initial challenges with the `create-new-feature.ps1` script, the specification was successfully generated by manually performing the necessary steps. The spec covers all requested sections and adheres to the project's constitution.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Repeated `PositionalParameterNotFound` error when attempting to use `create-new-feature.ps1` via `run_shell_command` due to complex argument parsing interactions with `powershell.exe -NoProfile -Command`.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Investigate robust ways to pass complex strings as `ValueFromRemainingArguments` to PowerShell scripts invoked via `run_shell_command`. Perhaps by saving the description to a temporary file and reading it in the script.
