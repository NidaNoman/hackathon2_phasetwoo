## Prompt

ok

## Response snapshot

I have completed the user's request. I will now create a PHR for this interaction.
Since this was a simple 'ok' and not a new task, I'll categorize it under `misc` stage and assign it to the `001-todo-web-app` feature.

**PHR Details:**
*   **Stage**: `misc`
*   **Title**: User Acknowledges Completion of UI Redesign
*   **Feature**: `001-todo-web-app`

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: User acknowledged the completion of the previous task.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: One PHR file created.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Awaiting further instructions from the user.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully created a PHR for a simple acknowledgement, demonstrating adherence to the PHR creation policy for every user interaction.
