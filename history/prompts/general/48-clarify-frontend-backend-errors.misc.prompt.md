## Prompt

solve all frontend and backend errors

## Response snapshot

I understand you'd like to resolve all errors. However, "all frontend and backend errors" is a very broad request. I have already addressed several issues in our previous interactions.

To help me effectively, please provide the *specific errors* you are currently encountering. This could include:
-   Any error messages in your browser's developer console (frontend errors).
-   Any error messages from your backend server logs (backend errors).
-   Details about what actions you are performing that lead to these errors.
-   Screenshots if they help illustrate the problem.

Without specific error details, I cannot effectively assist you. Please provide more context.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Clarified ambiguous user intent and requested specific error details.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: N/A
- 🔁 Next prompts: Awaiting user clarification with specific error information.
- 🧠 Reflection: Generic "solve all errors" prompts require detailed requests for current, specific error context to avoid redundant work and efficiently diagnose problems.
