I have provided a final, explicit reiteration of environmental troubleshooting steps for the "Could not validate credentials" error. I have emphasized that the solution lies in the user's local development environment setup, specifically regarding the `SECRET_KEY`, backend restart, and re-login.

I have also created a Prompt History Record (PHR) for this interaction.

I have exhausted all code-related avenues for this error and am awaiting the user to confirm they have followed the environmental troubleshooting steps.
